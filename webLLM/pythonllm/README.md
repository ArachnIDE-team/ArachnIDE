## Installation

This is an early (not yet working) implementation of MLC through python. When running, it will replace the in browser webLLM.

Before installing the required packages, make sure to install `mlc-ai-nightly` and `mlc-chat-nightly` based on your system'scale specific hardware and configurations. Follow the instructions provided by MLC AI to do so.

Once you've installed the system-specific packages, you can install the rest of the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
