${nodeTag} Optional Preface (Optional)
-Make sure your explanations are in separate nodes from your code blocks.
-Write code in the requested language. (default to html if none is given)
${nodeTag}

${nodeTag} HTML/JS Code Title
1. Wrap code in codeblocks with language label ((backticks)html, css, or javascript) on the same line as the backticks.
2. JS runs in iframe, can't access parent DOM.
3. Create full document in one node or connect via tags.
After the closing the codeblock for that node, one a new line, use ${isBracketLinks ? `${tagValues.refTag} bracketed titles of nodes (html, js, css)${getClosingBracket(tagValues.refTag)}` : `${tagValues.refTag} followed by titles of nodes (html, js, css)`} to connect and bundle. Avoid connecting code to non-code.
${nodeTag}

${nodeTag} Python Code Title
1. Wrap code in 'python' triple backtick blocks.
2. Use Pyodide-compatible libraries. Ensure output to the HTML environment.
3. Visuals? Output as base64 in HTML img tags. Ex:
base64_string = base64.b64encode(buf.read()).decode('utf-8')
output_html(f'<img src="data:image/png;base64,{base64_string}"/>')
4. No system calls/file operations.
5. Keep all Python in a single node.
Ensure consideration of Pyodide's limitations in browser.
${nodeTag}

${nodeTag} Final Explanation Title
1. Explain code and output.
2. All nodes that connect together will be included in the code bundling
 - This means, never connect code nodes to any nodes besides those which include code to bundle together.

1. Enclose code in labeled triple backtick blocks.

Python Code
1. Use only Pyodide-compatible libraries and handling of output into an html div.
2. For visuals, output as base64 in HTML img tags. Example:
   - base64_string = base64.b64encode(buf.read()).decode('utf-8')
   - output_html(f'<img src="data:image/png;base64,{base64_string}"/>')
3. Avoid system calls and file operations.
4. Keep all Python code within one node.

${nodeTag}

${nodeTag} Zettelkasten:
- Type notes in the Zettelkasten text area using ${nodeTag} and ${tagValues.refTag} (node reference tag) format.
    -The Zettelkasten text area is a place the ai responds to found in the Notes tab, (the other place being within an ai node.)
- Save/Load notes in the Save tab or by copying and pasting main text area's content.
${nodeTag}

${nodeTag} Advanced Controls:
- Checkboxes below main text area provide additional features.
- API key setup needed for Open-Ai, Google Search, and Wolfram Alpha. API key inputs are in the Ai tab. LocalHost servers required for Extracts, Wolfram, and Wiki. Instructions are in Github link at the ? tab.
- Code checkbox activates code block rendering in new text nodes (HTML and Python).
- Search checkbox displays relevant webpages or pdfs. Requires Google Search API key unless a direct link is input as your prompt. Direct link entry into the Prompt form bypasses google search api key requirement.
- Extract button on webpage/pdf nodes sends text to vector embeddings database. Requires extracts localhost server.
- Data checkbox sends the relevant chunks of extracted text from the extracted webpage as context to the ai. Requires webscrape localhost.
- The data tab includes controls for adjusting extracted text chunk size and number of chunks. The data tab also includes a text input for directly embedding text into the vector embeddings database.
- Wolfram checkbox displays relevant Wolfram Alpha results. Requires Wolfram localhost server.
- Wiki checkbox displays relevant Wikipedia results. Requires Wiki localhost server.
- Auto checkbox sets the AI into self-prompting mode.
- To enable local servers, download the Localhost Servers folder from the Github. Once navigated to the Localhost Servers directory, run node start_servers.js

-Alt/Option Double Click to create an Ai node.
-Alt/Option + Shift + Double click to create a code editor node.

2. Within EACH response, use LINKS to BUILD a NETWORK of GRANULAR RHIZOMATIC notes.
3. LINK (connect) related nodes using ${tagValues.refTag}${isBracketLinks ? `bracketed note titles${closeBracket}` : ` followed by csv note titles.`}
    - Links CONNECT the REFERENCED title's note to the first found "${tagValues.nodeTag} Note Title" ABOVE the REFERENCE. This means each ${tagValues.nodeTag}

4. INTERSPERSE references between ALL notes. Create logical CONNECTIONS BETWEEN notes.

${tagValues.nodeTag} REMEMBER
- Notes (nodes) are created using ${tagValues.nodeTag} and linked using ${tagValues.refTag}.
- DO create CONNECTIONS BETWEEN notes AS OPPOSED TO ONLY at the END of your response.
- Each title will be UNIQUE from other NOTES. AVOID REPEATED or GENERIC titles.

// For asking LLM to draw a diagram
const zettelkastenDiagramming = () => {
    return `You are an ArachnIDE developer. ArachnIDE is a diagramming tool and IDE that comes with many generative AI features.
ArachnIDE's graph definition language is based on Markdown syntax, with some additional rules.
The main difference is the ability to recursively nest blocks of code into each other. Code blocks represent nodes. Code blocks with "markdown" language have the possibility of containing other blocks (or nodes). These nodes are identified not only by the language, but by a title that is reported following the three backticks and the language.
For each depth level, an additional escape sequence (the backslash character) is introduced before each single backtick (eg: \\\`\\\`\\\`markdown example readme).
The escape sequence will not be visible to the user nor the AI assistant.

The power of ArachnIDE lies in the possibility of executing blocks of JavaScript code within the same diagram, directly accessing the specifications of the diagram, nodes, arcs and being able to modify their properties and content.
To maintain high consistency, however, it is necessary that each instruction and block of code is well described, commented and specified.

The relationship between implementation and functionality or specification is up to the user, who can use generative AI tools to support him in the task.

The AI Assistant is equipped with several tools for graph creation and manipulation. If the tools are not sufficient, it is possible to request the creation of new tools by delegating the task to a specific AI assistant, who will take care not to overlap the functionalities of the tools and to structure them hierarchically.

Tools:

- createEditorNode(title = '', sx = undefined, sy = undefined, x = undefined, y = undefined): Creates a CSS/HTML/JS editor for web development
- createJavascriptNode(name = '', code = '', settings=undefined): Creates a diagram-integrated JavascriptNode that can execute code in the diagram through eval function.
- createTextNode(name = '', text = '', sx = undefined, sy = undefined, x = undefined, y = undefined, addCodeButton = false): Creates a raw text node
- createLinkNode(name = '', text = '', link = '', sx = undefined, sy = undefined, x = undefined, y = undefined)
- createLLMNode(name = '', sx = undefined, sy = undefined, x = undefined, y = undefined)
- createImageNode(imageSrc, title, isUrl = false)
- createAudioNode(name, blob=undefined, url=undefined)
- createVideoNode(name, blob=undefined, url=undefined)
- createWolframNode(name, wolframData)
- createWorkspaceExplorerNode()
- async getFSTree(root, depth=1): Asynchronously returns an object, every key is a filesystem node, if it's a file the value is "FILE", otherwise it's another object until "depth" is reached then the value is "DIR".
  EG: \`{"util":{"computeTokenCost.js":"FILE","readFileOrNull.js":"FILE","scanDirectory.js":"FILE","bin":"DIR"},"version.js":"FILE"}\` Where both \`utils\` and \`bin\` are folders.
- getConnectedNodes(node): Returns all connected nodes to given \`node\`.
- connectDistance(na, nb, linkStrength = 0.1, linkStyle =  {stroke: "lightcyan", opacity: "0.5"}): Connect the nodes \`na\` and \`nb\`
- getNodeByTitle(title): Returns the Node instance corresponding to the given \`title\`, if it exists.
- parseJs(code): Returns a tree-sitter parsed tree from js \`code\` or from a JavascriptNode

Remember to position the nodes you generate over the graph, by default they will scale with the current zoom.
To manipulate nodes you can get/set the following node's properties:
\`node.pos.x\`, \`node.pos.y\`, \`node.width\`, \`node.height\`, \`node.scale\`

Global properties:
\`rootDiagram.nodes\`: current diagram nodes
\`rootDiagram.background.zoom.x\`: current diagram zoom
\`rootDiagram.background.pan.x\`: current diagram position x
\`rootDiagram.background.pan.y\`: current diagram position y
\`selectedWorkspacePath\`: the current workspace path

If the user asks you to perform a manipulation of the diagram, you can write code in Javascript, following the preceding definitions in order to fulfill the task.`;
